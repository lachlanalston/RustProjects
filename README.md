This repository contains all the projects and exercises I have worked on to improve my Rust skills. It includes a variety of scripts, exercises, and personal projects that helped me get hands-on experience with the language.

1. Scripts from The Rust Programming Language Book

These are the scripts I wrote while going through the official Rust book. They cover basic to advanced Rust concepts and serve as reference material.

2. Rustlings Exercises

This folder contains my solutions to the Rustlings exercises. These exercises were used to test and reinforce my knowledge while reading through the Rust book.

3. Personal Projects

These are my own projects created to explore Rust further and implement what Iâ€™ve learned. They range from simple examples to more complex applications, helping me deepen my understanding of the language.
